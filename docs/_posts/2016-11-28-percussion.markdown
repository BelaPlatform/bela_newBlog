Building a low latency percussion instrument with ceramic tiles, piezo disks, and Bela

In this post we're looking at percussion instruments and Bela. A percussion instrument was made using the eight analog inputs on the Bela board. The control interface of the instrument was made with eight ceramic tiles, each with a piezo element attached to the back. Striking the tiles triggers samples, all with a latency of less than 1ms!

Here's a video of us testing the first prototype:

Piezo disks generate a voltage when they are deformed and are great sensors for making drum triggers or detecting knocks or changes in pressure in solid objects. To connect the piezo disks to Bela it is best to use a simple voltage divider circuit using two equally valued resistors. The analog inputs on the Bela board have a voltage range of 0-4.096V. If we were to connect the piezo directly to the analog input we would end up clipping the negative part of the piezo signal (half-wave rectification). By using the voltage divider we realign the the zero point of the piezo signal up to around 2V, which gives us enough room to read both the positive and negative part of the piezo signal. Hereâ€™s an image of the voltage divider circuit for three piezo disks: in our circuit we used a 2 x 2.2 MOhm resistors for each piezo disk.

Once we had our signal coming in via the analog inputs we performed a peak detection routine on the signal to identify when a strike occurs on one of the tiles. This featured signal conditioning first (DC offset filter, full wave rectification and a moving average filter) followed by a peak detection algorithm which detects strikes on each of the tiles by looking for a downward trend in the sensor data when the incoming value is above a minimum threshold. Once a peak is detected the amplitude of the strike is measured and then assigned to a sample appropriate to the tile. Our synthesis engine was capable of 40 different voices with an oldest-out voice stealing algorithm if all voices became allocated to allow for fast repeated strikes. A single voice version of the code comes as an example with Bela: [example/Audio/sample-piezo-trigger](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/tree/master/examples/04-Audio).

This was all written in C++ using the browser-based IDE. The scope was an invaluable feature for debugging. When conditioning the signal we were able to watch the raw input signal simultaneously with a filtered version of itself and also to visualise the exact moment that a note was triggered, all in the browser.

Here's a photo of the second prototype instrument:
