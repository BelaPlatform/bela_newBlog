Created for the National Ethnographic museum in Warsaw by new media art and design collective panGenerator, the exhibition *ICONS* is a deep exploration of the daily rituals that make up our digital lives.

# Silicon spirituality

*ICONS* makes physical the digital symbolism that surrounds the actions of everyday life. The exhibition, created by Warsaw based new media art collective [panGenerator](https://pangenerator.com), presents the spectator with a series of physical manifestations of the elements of digital life, elements which normally remain intangible yet have real and meaningful effects on our lives and on how they are structured.

> Our exhibition takes a closer look at our shared cultural “imaginarium” of digital gestures, symbols, and artefacts, dragging them out onto a physical space, enabling audiences a direct, tactile confrontation and – also literally – a different visual perspective. (panGenerator)

By confronting the audience with these amplifications and apparitions of the symbolism and practices of digital culture they hope the audience will find a reflection of their own digital culture experience – from the slows beginnings of the digital age to the lightning pace of social media.

# Infinity scroll

One of the installations within the exhibition *Infinity* put our own [Trill Craft](https://shop.bela.io/products/trill-craft) to excellent use in the design of a large touch pad which the audience can use to navigate through an infinitely scrolling stream of light and images. The touch pad features a custom designed PCB which interfaces with Trill Craft and an Arduino board.
