We are excited to be participating in three events next week; the [Superbooth](https://www.superbooth.com/en/) modular synthesizer trade show in Berlin (20-22 April), the [Imperial College London CDT Festival of Science](http://cdt-festival.co.uk/) (21 April), and the [Anvil Hack](http://anvil.goldsmiths.tech/) creative computing hackathon at Goldsmiths University of London (22-23 April).

## Bela Booth and DIY Workshop at Superbooth, Berlin

We have for a long time been excited about the possibilities of combining Bela with modular synthesizers. One year ago we created this demo of combining Bela with the Doepfer Dark Energy II:

This year we are taking things a step further by [exhibiting Bela](https://www.superbooth.com/en/bela.html) at Superbooth! We are extremely excited to meet the makers and players of this community, and to share an exclusive preview of an experimental prototype for a limited edition *Bela Eurorack Modular kit*! If you are attending, please [drop by our booth](https://www.superbooth.com/en/floorplan.html?location=e260) or [get in touch](mailto:info@bela.io) ! Additionally, Bela's Dr. Andrew McPherson will be exhibiting the [TouchKeys](http://touchkeys.co.uk/) project at the booth next door (and will be premiering some new demos...).

We are also [running a hands-on workshop](https://www.superbooth.com/en/eventdetails/bela-embedded-platform-diy-workshop.html) to introduce audio programming and instrument design with Bela, from 11:00 - 15:00 on Friday 21 April. We hope to see you there!

## Bela Exhibit at Imperial CDT Festival of Science

The Bela team will be present at the [CDT Festival of Science](http://cdt-festival.co.uk/) hosted by Imperial College London, which this year is themed around "Science and Art - Exploring Creativity". We will be bringing along demos and kits for people to explore their creativity with!
