# Kickstarter 16th September 2019

From computer interfaces to textiles, musical instruments to interactive artworks, we experience the world by touching it. At Bela we know that getting touch right in the design of instruments and interactive devices is essential, and this is where the Trill sensors come in.

The Trill sensors use capacitive sensing to precisely track finger movements, making it quick and easy to create beautifully responsive new touch interfaces.
