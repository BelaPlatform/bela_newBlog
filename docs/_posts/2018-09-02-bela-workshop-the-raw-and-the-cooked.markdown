On 29th September 2018 we will be giving a hands-on [Bela workshop](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/cooked.html#workshop_bela) as part of [The RAW and The COOKED](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/) in London.

[The RAW and The COOKED](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/) takes over Cafe1001 on Brick Lane for a weekend of workshops, talks and live performances. Fostering an open source ethos to sharing and developing new skills, the event brings together the best of today's pioneering musical movements. Our Bela workshop will focus on creating interactive music projects using Pd. Participants will be guided through some simple circuit-building and Pd programming activities. Bela kits, breadboards, sensors and other electronics will be provided for use during the workshop.

The event, hosted by the Media & Arts Technology Centre for Doctoral Training at Queen Mary University of London, fuses practical workshops and demonstrations with theoretical presentations of current practice in Live Coding and DIY instrument/modular synth building. Targeting both complete beginners and experts alike the daytime section of the events opens up new possibilities and tools, which are explored further during two evenings of live performances in an informal club environment. Note that to attend the workshops you need to [buy a day or weekend ticket](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-raw-and-the-cooked-tickets-49375371064) and then register for the free workshops.

It's going to be an action packed day on Saturday kicking off with a modular synth workshop from our friends at [Glasgow Make Some Noise](https://gmsn.co.uk/), followed by a talk from Tom Whitwell from [Music Thing Modular](https://musicthing.co.uk/) and synth builder [Ewa Justka](http://ewajustka.tumblr.com/). The evening programme is packed with performances including [A Colder Consciousness](https://www.mixcloud.com/acolderconsciousness/) (Resonance FM) and [Lia Mice](https://www.liamice.com/), and if that's not enough Friday night is a full-blown [Algorave](https://therawandthecooked.intersections.io/raw.html). Hope to see you there if you're London-based!
