Happy new year from the Bela team. Bring on 2021! In this post we're going to keep our heads up and focus on all the positives of 2020 by taking a sample of some of the most exciting projects built by the Bela community throughout the year.

# 2020 for the Bela Team

 We could have never have imagined all the challenges and changes that 2020 would bring about and we truly hope that everyone is staying safe and well. Throughout 2020 we've been fortunate to be able to continue working from home without too much disruption. We've been working hard developing new tools and educational materials to help makers and artists realise their projects. Here is a brief summary of the key events in the Bela 2020 calendar:

- April: launched our Youtube lecture series [C++ Real-Time Audio Programming with Bela](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCrgFeG6pwQmdbB6l3ehC8oBBZbatVoz3)
- May: launched our knowledge base [learn.bela.io](https://learn.bela.io)
- June: delivered our [Trill Kickstarter](https://shop.bela.io/collections/trill) rewards
- July: sponsored [NIME 2020](https://nime2020.bcu.ac.uk/) with prizes and funding for 20 registrations for underrepresented voices
- September: [e-textiles tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClBYyYEFkF0) by Becky Stewart
- December: launched our [Pure Data + Bela tutorial](https://learn.bela.io/tutorials/pure-data/fundamentals/course-introduction/)

As busy as we've been, we have nothing on the Bela community of makers, musicians, artists, designers, researchers, tinkerers and engineers from all over the world.
The projects this community creates, from interactive installations to instruments, synthesisers to sound sculptures, never fail to amaze us. We remain in awe and deeply humbled to be part of this community and to give people the tools they need to create such inspiring and beautiful work.

# 2020 Bela Project Roundup

Here is just a sample of the incredible projects that were created using Bela in 2020.

# The Book of Knowledge of Impractical Musical Devices

{% include youtube.html youtube="PK-B3nACqkI" %}

Yann Seznec introduced us to the Book of Knowledge of Impractical Musical Devices. This series of three musical devices are each guided by very specific rules which encourage players to reflect on their listening experience. Yann used Bela in a couple of them including in his auto-destructive work, Volume 3: Everything You Love Will One Day Be Taken From You.

# What are you working on?

When we created Bela we couldn't have imagined the breadth of applications, installations, instruments, inventions and interventions that Bela would be part of. We love to hear about what you're working on, and regularly feature projects on our blog. If you'd like to share your project, please get in touch and tell us all about it.

Here's to 2021 and to all the Bela projects to come!
