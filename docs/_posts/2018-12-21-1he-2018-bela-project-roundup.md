Bela has been busy, but the makers in the Bela community have been busier. In this post we survey a sample of the exciting projects built by the Bela community of creators.

2018 has been a banner year for Bela. We've launched [three]() [new] [products], held workshops and [talks](https://loop.ableton.com/2018/program/activity/touch-code-play-creating-hybrid-physical-digital-music-instruments/) all over the world, and even built a new and expanded [website](https://bela.io).

The global Bela community of makers, musicians, artists, designers, researchers, tinkerers and engineers has been hard at work too, using Bela to produce inspiring, exciting, and beautiful things. From installations to instruments, synthesizers to sound sculptures, 

Here's some of our favourites, in no particular order.

# Opal Rhythm Computor

Ed (aka [DMX Krew](https://www.discogs.com/artist/983-DMX-Krew)) is a master of electronic beats but hadn't ever soldered, made a circuit, or programmed before, but he used Bela and PureData to create an epic build of a drum machine and sampler modelled on the RSF SD140 - everything done from scratch.

# What are you working on?

When we created Bela we couldn't have imagined the breadth of applications, installations, instruments, inventions and interventions that Bela would be part of.
