Are you an instrument maker? An e-textile designer? Do you make your own synth modules, effects boxes or pedals? Bela is used in all these projects, and even more - from interactive art to robotics research, Bela is the core of a huge variety of applications that need high quality and ultra-low latency audio and sensor processing on an embedded board.
