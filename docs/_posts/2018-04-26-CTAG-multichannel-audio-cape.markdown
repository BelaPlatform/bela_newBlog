We are excited to announce the upcoming release of the CTAG FACE and BEAST multichannel audio systems.

{% include single-image.html fileName="FACE.jpg" caption="A FACE cape installed on a BeagleBone Black" %}

Developed by Robert Manzke and Henrik Langer of [Creative Technologies AG](http://www.creative-technologies.de) (CTAG) at the University of Kiel in collaboration with Bela, the FACE is a cape for the BeagleBone Black with 4 audio input channels and 8 audio output channels. The BEAST, created by stacking two FACE capes on top of each other, doubles the amount of available audio I/O to an impressive 8 input channels and 16 output channels.

The CTAG capes are fully compatible with Bela, and can take advantage of Bela's unrivalled [sub-millisecond latency](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/What-is-Bela%3F), along with Bela's streamlined workflow and [development tools](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/Bela-IDE). They can even be used together with a [Bela cape](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/wiki/Hardware-explained) to gain access to Bela's 8 DC coupled analog inputs and outputs. They can also be used with ALSA drivers for compatability with standard linux applications.

The capes will available for preorder at a special discounted price from the Bela shop very soon. To be the first to hear when more info is released, [sign up to our mailing list](https://bela.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=984c0ed7483851c64760303d2&id=d2150b705c).
