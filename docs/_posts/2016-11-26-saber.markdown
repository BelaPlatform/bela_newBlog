Rapid Prototyping and Sound Design with Bela

In this project Robbie and Chris explain how to make a super-sensitive audio lightsaber from a cardboard tube, an accelerometer, a piezo disk and Bela. They use Puredata for the sound design and sensor processing to make a working lightsaber fit for a Jedi! The Heavy Compiler from Enzien Audio is used to produce optimised C code from their Puredata patches to run on the board.

In the video below they walk through the steps they took to recreate the famous swooping sound design of the lightsaber using a looped sample of tv hum and variable delay lines. They then explain how to bring this sound model to life as a piece of interactive hardware, with an accelerometer to calculate the velocity of the cardboard tube and a piezo disk to detect impacts. This is definitely one to try at home, may the force be with you!
