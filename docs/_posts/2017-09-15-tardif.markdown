[Pierre Tardif](http://codingcoolsh.it/index.html) shared this video of a performance he did as part of the Water Tower Festival 2017.

Pierre created a [custom instrument from a sheep's skull](http://www.codingcoolsh.it/installations.html#SkullVibrations), Bela and other bits of sound processing electronic hardware. In the above video he uses this instrument as part of his live set performing 'concrete music' within an industrial concrete landscape at the Water Tower Festival. By using a piezo sensor the nuanced vibrations generated when any part of the surface of the skull is touched are processed to render a unique live audio response.
