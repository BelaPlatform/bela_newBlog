*Of these moments in-between, everything* is a 20-channel sound installation created by Nicholas Knouf that fills the gallery with hanging miniature speakers relaying tranmissions from satellites orbiting the world.

## they transmitted continuously / but our times rarely aligned / and their signals dissipated in the Ã¦ther

This 20-channel sound installation presents the results of collecting hundreds of transmissions from satellites in orbit around the earth.

Nicholas built a series of custom antennas from scratch and used them to track the orbits and frequencies of satellites using a specialised software. This software then allowed him to collect the radio frequency signals of each satellite and to translate them into sound. 

The transmissions are mostly from weather satellites, CubeSats (small satellites launched by universities world-wide for short-term research), or amateur radio repeaters (satellites designed for ham radio operators to experiment with communication over long distances).

Nicholas made the speakers from a piezoelectric element embedded between two sheets of handmade abaca paper that was then air dried over a form. These were then hung from the light grid in the gallery.

# How Bela was used

Nicholas used Bela in combination with [audio expander capelet](https://shop.bela.io/bela-accessories/bela-audio-expander-capelet-preorder-shipping-in-march) to create this installation. He also used SuperCollider. Add some more info here.
